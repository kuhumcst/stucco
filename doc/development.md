Development
===========

Prerequisites
-------------
The development workflow of the project itself is built around the [Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli) for managing dependencies and [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) for compiling ClojureScript code and providing a live-reloading development environment.

In this project, the dependency management feature of shadow-cljs is not used directly. Rather, I leverage the built-in support in shadow-cljs for the Clojure CLI/deps.edn to download dependencies and build a classpath.

I personally use IntelliJ with the Cursive plugin which [integrates quite well with the Clojure CLI](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/deps.html).

### macOS setup
(assuming [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) has already been installed)


I'm not sure which JDK version you need, but anything 8+ is probably fine! I personally just use the latest from AdoptOpenJDK (currently JDK 13):

```
brew cask install adoptopenjdk
```

The following will get you the Clojure CLI and shadow-cljs, along with NodeJS:

```
brew install clojure/tools/clojure
brew install node
npm install -g shadow-cljs
```

Workflow
--------
Development of the project is done using the live-reloading capabilities of shadow-cljs:

```
shadow-cljs watch app
```

This will start a basic web server at `localhost:7000` serving the `:app` build as specified in the `shadow-cljs.edn` file.

It's possible to execute unit tests while developing by also specifying the `:test` build:

```
shadow-cljs watch app test
```

This will make test output available at `localhost:7100`. It's quite convenient to keep a separate browser tab open just for this. The favicon will be coloured green or red depending on the state of the assertions.

Personally, I use the Clojure CLI integration in Cursive to calculate a classpath and download dependencies. Something like this command is being executed behind the scenes:

```
clj -A:app:test -Spath
```

I have also set up some aliases in my personal [~/.clojure/deps.edn](https://github.com/simongray/dotfiles/blob/master/dot/clojure/deps.edn) file to perform certain common tasks such as listing/updating outdated packages:

```
clj -A:outdated
clj -A:update
```
